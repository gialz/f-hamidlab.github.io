"People who play together, stay together."

<br><br>

We have (un)officially adopted Sashagale Henry and Ebu Lily Bickel into our team. 
These ladies are technicians who share the same office space as us and they
have made our days so much brighter. We enjoy their lovely companion, jokes
and banter, and it is our great pleasure to have them in our team.
